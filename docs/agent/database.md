title: Site Database: Prisma Postgres, schema, indexes, migrations
read-when: before touching Prisma, the schema, a migration, seed data or any table
---
The Site Database is Prisma Postgres, one per site (live) plus a separate Preview Database in the
editor. Prisma ORM 7 ONLY (`prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/adapter-ppg`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`
pinned to 7.x). Generator `prisma-client`, `runtime = "workerd"`, output `src/generated/prisma`
(git-ignored; `npm run build` runs `prisma generate`); a second, test-only generator writes a Node
build to `src/generated/prisma-node` (never import it). `getDb()` returns the request's client, or
`null` without `DATABASE_URL`. The driver follows the URL's host: `*.prisma.io` (live, Preview) →
`adapter-ppg` over HTTPS; any other host (a local Postgres, tests) →
`adapter-pg` over TCP. Deployed sites only ever get Prisma Postgres (raw TCP is blocked there).

## Connections (serverless)
- ONE client per request from `getDb()` (`c.var.db` in routes): never `new PrismaClient()`,
  never a client in module scope, never one shared across requests.
- Live and Preview (`*.prisma.io`): `adapter-ppg`, Prisma Postgres's serverless driver over
  HTTPS. There is no TCP pool to size or exhaust: Prisma Postgres pools on its side, and every
  query is one HTTPS round trip, so fewer, bounded queries matter more than anything else.
- Locally and in tests (plain Postgres): `adapter-pg` with `max: 1` and a 1 s idle timeout, a
  short-lived connection per request.
- `DATABASE_URL` is the only URL: the same direct Prisma Postgres connection string serves the
  driver and the Prisma CLI (`migrate dev`, `studio` in the editor). There is no separate
  pooled/Accelerate URL and no `directUrl`; never add one or point it anywhere else. Deploy-time
  migrations are run by the platform with its own credentials.

## Tables
- MANAGED (auth core, change only through a template upgrade): `users`, `roles`, `permissions`,
  `role_permissions`, `user_roles`, `refresh_tokens`, `password_resets`, `email_verifications`,
  `email_changes`, `sign_in_codes`, `recovery_codes`, `login_attempts`, `audit_events`,
  `auth_state`, `job_deliveries` (background job replay guard). Read them through
  `src/platform/auth`; the only rows you add by migration are roles and role grants
  (`roles-and-permissions.md`). Codenames come from the catalogue, never a migration.
- Yours: `jobs`, and every table you add.

## Column types
| Data | Prisma | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | `Int @id @default(autoincrement())`; `BigInt` for append-heavy tables (logs, events) | small, ordered (keyset paging); serialize `BigInt` as a string in JSON |
| public / unguessable id | a separate `@unique` column (`token String @db.VarChar(43)`, random) | never expose sequence ids as the only secret (`security.md` › A01) |
| foreign key | `Int @map("owner_id")`, same type as the target id | |
| text | `String @db.VarChar(n)`, `n` = the validator's max | the column refuses what the validator missed |
| long text | `@db.VarChar(10000)` like `jobs.description`, or `@db.Text` with a validator cap | |
| money | `Int` minor units (`priceCents`) + `currency String @db.Char(3)` | never `Float`; `Decimal` only for rates/quantities with fixed scale |
| time | `DateTime @db.Timestamptz(3)` for new columns | an instant, stored in UTC either way; the managed tables use `TIMESTAMP(3)` (Prisma writes UTC): compare to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in raw SQL only on `timestamptz` |
| a date with no time (birthday, due day) | `DateTime @db.Date` | no time-zone drift |
| flag | `Boolean @default(false)` | |
| small fixed set | `String @db.VarChar(n)` + validator allow-list + CHECK (below), like `jobs.status` | adding a value is a code change, not a type change; a Prisma `enum` is a Postgres type: renaming or removing a value is a migration that waits for approval |
| set the owner edits (categories, tags) | a lookup table with an FK | rows, not code |
| JSON | `Json @db.JsonB` only for opaque snapshots (`audit_events.meta`) | never for anything you filter, join, sort, count or validate field by field |
| email of a user | don't copy it: FK to `users.id` | one place to change and delete |
Every column is NOT NULL unless "unknown" is a real state; give new columns on existing tables a
`@default` (or make them nullable: expand, below). `createdAt @default(now())` and
`updatedAt @updatedAt` on every table. snake_case in the database (`@map`, `@@map`), camelCase
in code.

## Constraints
- **Unique** where the product says "only one": `@unique` / `@@unique([teamId, slug])`. Catch
  `P2002` in the route and answer 409 in words (`jobs.ts` create).
- **Foreign keys** with an explicit `onDelete`: `Cascade` when the child means nothing without the
  parent (team → members), `Restrict` when deleting the parent must be refused, `SetNull` when the
  child outlives it (the column nullable). Rows pointing at `users`: decide per table, since
  deleting an account deletes the user row (cascading only managed tables). `jobs.created_by`
  has no FK on purpose ("a job outlives its poster"); to keep yours, use no FK or `SetNull`;
  to drop them with the account, `Cascade`.
- **CHECK constraints**: Prisma's schema can't express them; add them in the migration SQL. Prisma
  ignores them afterwards (they survive later migrations):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE "orders" ADD CONSTRAINT "orders_status_check"
    CHECK ("status" IN ('pending', 'paid', 'cancelled'));
  ALTER TABLE "orders" ADD CONSTRAINT "orders_total_check" CHECK ("total_cents" >= 0);
  ```
- The validator still checks everything first: a constraint error is a 500 unless you map it.

## Indexes
Each index speeds reads and costs every insert/update. One per QUERY SHAPE, no more.
- **Order**: equality columns first, then the ONE range or sort column, ending in `id` so it
  covers the keyset order:
  | Query | Index |
  | --- | --- |
  | my rows, newest first (`where ownerId`, `orderBy id desc`) | `@@index([ownerId, id])` |
  | open rows by id (`jobs`) | `@@index([status, id])` |
  | a team's rows by time (`where teamId`, `orderBy [createdAt desc, id desc]`) | `@@index([teamId, createdAt(sort: Desc), id(sort: Desc)])` |
  | lookup by a unique value | `@unique` (it is the index) |
  | rate check (`senderId`, `createdAt > t`) | `@@index([senderId, createdAt])` |
- **Foreign keys**: Postgres does not index them. Every FK column is the FIRST column of some
  index (or of the primary key), else a cascade delete or "children of X" scans the table.
- **Partial indexes** (only the rows a query reads: not-deleted, open, pending) and **expression
  indexes** (`lower(email)`) are SQL in the migration; Prisma's schema can't hold them:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX "notes_owner_live_idx" ON "notes" ("owner_id", "id") WHERE "deleted_at" IS NULL;
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "teams_slug_live_key" ON "teams" ("slug") WHERE "deleted_at" IS NULL;
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "contacts_team_email_key" ON "contacts" ("team_id", lower("email"));
  ```
  Then open EVERY later `--create-only` migration: if it contains `DROP INDEX` for one of yours,
  delete that line before applying.
- **Case-insensitive unique** (emails, handles): store it normalized (trimmed, lower-cased in the
  validator, as `users.email` is) with a plain `@unique`; or the `lower()` unique index above.
  Query with the same normalization. `mode: 'insensitive'` (ILIKE) can't use a b-tree index.
- **Search**: `contains` scans; fine for hundreds of rows. Before thousands, a `pg_trgm` GIN index
  or a `tsvector` column (migration SQL) or exact-value search only.
- **Write-heavy tables** (events, logs, counters): the primary key plus the one or two indexes
  their reads need; no index "just in case".
- **Big live tables**: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` doesn't lock writes but can't run in a
  transaction, and a migration file runs as one: put it ALONE in its own migration (one
  statement, no `BEGIN`), name it as Prisma would (`<table>_<cols>_idx`) so the schema's
  `@@index` matches, and use `IF NOT EXISTS`. A failed concurrent build leaves an INVALID index:
  check `SELECT indexrelid::regclass FROM pg_index WHERE NOT indisvalid;`, drop it and retry in
  a new migration. Small tables (a few thousand rows): a normal index in the transaction is fine.
- Check a doubtful plan with `EXPLAIN` in Prisma Studio / psql on the Preview Database.

## Queries
- Explicit `select` always; `take` ≤ 100; keyset paging, never `skip` (`performance.md`).
- **No N+1**: related rows in the same query or one `in` query:
  ```ts
  // WRONG: one query per row
  for (const p of posts) p.author = await db.user.findUnique({where: {id: p.authorId}});
  // RIGHT: one query, only the fields shown
  const posts = await db.post.findMany({
    where: {teamId}, orderBy: {id: 'desc'}, take: 21,
    select: {id: true, title: true, author: {select: {id: true, name: true}}},
  });
  ```
  Without a relation (no FK): collect ids, `findMany({where: {id: {in: ids}}, select})` (bounded),
  join in a `Map`. A nested `include` of a to-many relation is bounded too (`take`).
- **Transactions**: the batch form `db.$transaction([a, b])` (as the admin routes do), or the
  callback form for a read-then-write that must be consistent. Keep them short: no platform
  call, `sendJob` or email inside one (do those after commit). A single conditional `updateMany`
  (`where: {id, status: 'open'}`, check `count`) is often all you need.
- **Counts kept on write**: never `count()` a growing table per request. Keep a counter column
  and change it in the SAME transaction as the row:
  ```ts
  await db.$transaction([
    db.comment.create({data: {postId, authorId: me, body}, select: {id: true}}),
    db.post.update({where: {id: postId}, data: {commentCount: {increment: 1}}, select: {id: true}}),
  ]);
  ```
  Delete decrements the same way. Exact totals for an admin report: a background job writes them.

## Soft delete, hard delete, personal data
- **Hard delete** by default: it is what "delete" means to a person, and what privacy law expects
  for personal data. `deleteMany({where: {id, ownerId}})`, check `count`.
- **Soft delete** (`deletedAt DateTime? @db.Timestamptz(3)`) only when the product needs undo,
  a trash or history: every read adds `deletedAt: null`, the partial indexes above cover it,
  unique rules are partial unique indexes, and a scheduled job (`background-jobs.md`) purges rows
  older than the retention period in bounded batches.
- **Account deletion** removes the `users` row and its managed rows; your rows stay unless their
  FK cascades. Decide per table and say so in the feature: personal content (notes, messages,
  profiles) → `Cascade` or a cleanup job; shared records (orders, posts others rely on) →
  `SetNull` / no FK, with the personal fields cleared.
- **Export** (a person asks for their data): a route gated by a codename (or the user themself),
  building a bounded JSON of THEIR rows with explicit `select`s, audited. Large exports are a
  background job.
- Store the minimum: no copies of emails, no free-text fields "for later", no raw IPs.

## Migrations: forward-only
1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name <what_changed>` (snake_case).
3. Open the new `prisma/migrations/<ts>_<name>/migration.sql`: check it, add CHECKs / partial
   indexes, and wrap it in `BEGIN;` … `COMMIT;` (unless it is a `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`:
   then that ONE statement, no BEGIN).
4. `npx prisma migrate dev` applies it to the Preview Database.
5. `npx prisma generate`: Prisma 7's `migrate dev` no longer regenerates the client, and until
   you do, `db.<newModel>` is `undefined` in the running Preview ("Cannot read properties of
   undefined (reading 'findMany')"). The dev server reloads by itself after it. Run the app,
   then commit the schema and the migration.
- `migrate dev --create-only` first APPLIES any migration that is still pending (a second
  `--create-only` applies the first): write and check one migration at a time.
- On your own machine the Prisma CLI reads `DATABASE_URL` (and `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`) from
  `.env` (`prisma.config.ts`); in the editor they are already in the environment.
- Never edit, rename or delete a migration that exists in git: it may already be applied live.
- Publish applies pending migrations BEFORE the new code goes live; a failure keeps the old
  version serving. A migration that drops, truncates or changes a type waits for the owner's
  approval at Publish.
- The OLD code keeps running for a while on the NEW schema (and a redeploy can roll code back):
  every migration must be safe for the previous version too.

## Expand, migrate, contract
Renaming `title` → `name`, splitting a column, or making one required is several Publishes:
1. EXPAND: add the new column nullable (or with a default); code writes both, reads the old.
2. BACKFILL: `UPDATE "t" SET "name" = "title" WHERE "name" IS NULL;` For a big table, in
   batches (`WHERE "id" IN (SELECT "id" FROM "t" WHERE "name" IS NULL LIMIT 5000)` across
   several migrations, or a bounded background job), never one statement over millions of rows.
3. SWITCH: code reads the new column (and still writes both).
4. CONTRACT, a later Publish once nothing reads the old column (owner approves): stop writing it,
   then drop it; `SET NOT NULL` after the backfill is complete.
Never in one release: rename or drop a column/table the running code reads, add a `NOT NULL`
column without a default to a table with rows, change a column's type in place, add a unique
constraint before the duplicates are gone, or drop a column in the same release the code stops
using it.

## A new model, end to end
The model with `@@map("snake_table")`, `@map` columns, lengths, types from the table above,
`createdAt`/`updatedAt`, FKs with `onDelete` and their indexes, one `@@index` per query shape →
migration (+ CHECKs, partial indexes) → `npx prisma generate` → a route with an explicit `select`,
keyset paging and the access checks (`roles-and-permissions.md`) → an integration test of who may
and may not (add its table to the `TRUNCATE` in `tests/integration/support/harness.ts`).

## Tests against a real database
`TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://…/<throwaway db> npm test` runs `tests/integration/*` (the real
Site API, cookies, CSRF) after `npx prisma migrate deploy` on that database. The tests EMPTY its
tables: never point it at a database you care about. Without the variable they are skipped.
Add an integration test for every new route that guards data (who may, who may not).

## Seed and tools
- `prisma/seed.sql`: fake rows for the Preview Database only (example.com addresses, no users or
  passwords), idempotent (`WHERE NOT EXISTS`). `npx prisma db seed` runs it.
- `npm run studio` opens Prisma Studio on port 5555 (Preview Database). Resetting the Preview
  Database (`prisma migrate reset`) is the owner's call: ask first.
- No `DATABASE_URL` = the Site Database is not enabled: routes answer 503. Ask the owner to enable
  it in the site's Database tab; never point it anywhere else.
